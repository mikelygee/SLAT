/**
 * @brief Complex_IM
 * 
 * A 'Complex_IM' object represents an intensity measurement function, which
 * has separate functions describing the behaviour in the X and Y directions.
 *
 * It has three deterministic functions: one for each of the X and Y directions, 
 * and another, 'base' function which is used as a reference for the other two.
 *
 * At this point, I expect the three functions to be generated using NZS 1170, 
 * with the base function using a period of 0, and the X and Y functions using 
 * the fundamental periods of the structure in the respective directions.
 *
 * The functions will be 'aligned' based on the rate-of-exceedance. That is, 
 * given a value for the base acceleration, the X and Y accelerations will be
 * those which have the same rate-of-exceedance as that of the base value.
